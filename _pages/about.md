I am a junior group leader at [NIAB](https://www.niab.com) in Cambridge, applying mathematics to various problems in crop science.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in Cambridge University working in Chris Wallace's group applying ML and classical statistics to large human genetics data. Before that, I was a postoc at Manchester University with Prof Ross King, working on yeast and _lollium perenne_ datasets.

My background is in Probability Theory and I hold a Ph.D. in the subject from Warwick University. Currently, I am a supervisror for IB Markov Chains at the University of Cambridge. I am also a Senior Member at Newnham College.
